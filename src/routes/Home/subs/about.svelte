        <div>Home to the Indus Valley Civilization and a region of historic routes and vast empires, the Indian subcontinent was identified with its commercial and cultural wealth for
        much of its long history. Four major world religions, Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated there,
        while Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam arrived in the first millennium CE and shaped the regionâ€™s
        diverse culture. India got its independence on August 15th. 1947. It was the day when the Indians got liberated
        from the rule of the British. Agriculture is not only the dominant occupation of the people of India but is also
        one of the most important economic sectors for the country.</div>
